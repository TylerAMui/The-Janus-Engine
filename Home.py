Version 10.2 adds comprehensive export functionality and reorganizes API configuration for future scalability.

**Key Features:**

1. **üì• Export Functionality (Critical Feature):**
   - Download analysis results as **Markdown** (.md) or **Plain Text** (.txt)
   - Available on all 4 analysis pages immediately after results display
   - Comprehensive metadata included: timestamp, analysis type/mode, lens/persona config, work details, API usage metrics
   - Dual metadata tracking for Comparative analysis (Work A + Work B)
   - Timestamp-based file naming prevents overwrites

2. **üìñ In-App Documentation Page:**
   - Complete user guide accessible as 6th navigation page
   - Covers architecture, analysis modes, lens library, configuration, best practices, troubleshooting
   - Version history and changelog
   - No need to leave the app or read repository documentation

3. **üîë Centralized API Configuration (Scalability Upgrade):**
   - API configuration moved from sidebar to Home page
   - Infrastructure setup separated from workflow preferences
   - **Multi-provider framework ready:** Designed to support OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and other providers in future releases
   - Sidebar now dedicated to workflow settings only (Analysis Mode)
   - Visual status indicators (‚úÖ Configured / ‚ùå Not Configured)

---

### Previous Features (v10.1)

**Multi-Dimensional Filtering & Lens Consolidation:**

1. **Unified Multi-Dimensional Filter System (UX Enhancement):**
   - All analysis pages now feature the Library's advanced filtering: **Discipline √ó Function √ó Era**
   - Filter by academic discipline (Art History, Philosophy, Theology, etc.)
   - Filter by functional tier (What it is / How it works / Why it matters)
   - Filter by historical era (Ancient ‚Üí Contemporary)
   - All filters are optional and work in combination for precise lens discovery
   - Makes navigating 157+ lenses intuitive and manageable

2. **Three-Tier Persona Selection (Analytical Control):**
   - **(All Personas - AI Decides):** Default mode - AI selects the most appropriate historical figure from the persona pool based on content analysis
   - **(No Persona - Generic Title):** Uses an archetypal title specific to the framework (e.g., "The Republican Theorist" for Republicanism)
   - **Specific Persona:** Lock analysis to a particular historical figure from the pool

3. **Era-Spanning Political Ideology Lenses (Historical Depth):**
   - Added **Republicanism**, **Democracy**, **Conservatism**, and **Socialism** with persona pools spanning multiple eras
   - Example: Republicanism includes Cicero (Ancient), Jefferson & Madison (Early Modern Period), Lincoln (19th Century), and Arendt (20th Century)
   - AI can select personas from different historical periods to match the work's context

4. **Multi-Discipline Lens Membership (Contextual Analysis):**
   - Lenses can now appear in multiple discipline categories
   - Example: **Stoicism** appears in both "Ethics" and "Individual Philosophy" for context-specific analysis
   - **Post-Structuralism** spans Metaphysics, Literary Theory, Individual Philosophy, and Sociology
   - Provides nuanced analysis based on the user's selected discipline filter

5. **Lens Consolidation (Library Refinement):**
   - Consolidated overly specific "person-isms" into broader frameworks with persona pools:
     - **Deontology** (from Kantianism) - now includes Kant, W.D. Ross, Christine Korsgaard, Thomas Nagel
     - **Egoism** (from Objectivism) - now includes Ayn Rand, Max Stirner, Friedrich Nietzsche
     - **Idealism** (from Platonism + Hegelian Idealism) - now includes Plato, Berkeley, Hegel, Royce, Bradley
     - **Psychoanalytic Theory** (from Freudianism, Jungian Analysis, Lacanianism) - toolkit with 11 sub-primers covering all three schools
     - **Buddhism** (from Chan/Zen, TheravƒÅda, Tibetan variants) - toolkit with 3 sub-primers for each tradition
     - **Christian Theology** (from Catholic, Protestant, Liberation Theology) - toolkit with 3 sub-primers for each tradition
   - Reduces granularity bloat while preserving analytical depth through persona pools and sub-primers toolkits
   - Total lens count optimized from ~163 to 157 lenses

6. **Film Movement Lenses (Visual Culture):**
   - Added 10 cinema movement lenses: Cinema Novo, Dogme 95, Film Noir, French New Wave, German Expressionism, Italian Neorealism, New Hollywood, Soviet Montage, Third Cinema

7. **Mythology Lens Reorganization:**
   - Renamed all mythology lenses for better readability (e.g., "Norse Myth", "Greco-Roman Myth", "Egyptian Myth")
