The Janus Engine (v8.0) leverages advanced AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro) to help you analyze creative works‚Äîtext, images, or audio‚Äîfrom multiple perspectives simultaneously. 

It utilizes a unique **"General and Soldier"** architecture:
1. **The General (Meta-Prompt):** You provide a lens (e.g., "Marxist", "Jungian"). The AI first analyzes your input work and designs the optimal strategy (prompt) for applying that lens to that specific work.
2. **The Soldier (Execution):** The AI executes the custom-designed prompt, generating a deep, nuanced analysis.

The "Analyst-in-Chief" (a specialized AI agent) will first analyze your input work and determine the most potent combination of lenses for the analysis, providing a justification for its choices before proceeding.
